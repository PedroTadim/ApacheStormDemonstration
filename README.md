# ApacheStormDemonstration
Apache Storm's streaming platform demonstration using Java NIO sockets.

Simple NIO server that listens for setences writen by the clients and outputs in the server, the number of words written. 

This example is used on my master thesis to demonstrate the Apache Storm's usage. 

Credits to my supervisor Dr. Jose Orlando Pereira form university of Minho from whom I used some of his code demonstrated in a lecture to build this project.
